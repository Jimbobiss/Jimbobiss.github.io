                    <p>
                        My name is James and I'm a <span id="age-container"></span> year old amateur developer from
                        the UK. Thus-far in my career I have worked as CADCAM Engineer in the furniture industry, but
                        I have been making small programming projects on the side since I was about 14 years
                        old.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm in the process of actively refining my skills and exploring new technologies -
                        one of my ultimate goals is to build my own fully-functional and released application
                        for the web, iOS and Android platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not working I like to play a bit of golf with my friends (even though I'm dreadful),
                        run recreationally and occasionally do some cycling. I am also a big fan of visiting the many
                        beautiful National Trust properties around the country, as well as planning and undertaking
                        challenging hikes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this page you can get a taste of some of the projects I've developed and I hope that it will
                        serve as a centralised location for all my programming news. Thank you for stopping by!

                <p>
                    As part of my learning experience with HTML and CSS, I produced a small test blog
                    documenting my experiences with a new CNC machine I was learning to use at work. 
                    This was my first ever webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It discusses the early stages and steps I took to try to familiarise 
                    myself with the machine and its associated software, with a view of reaching a working 
                    proficiency. The main motivation for the blog was to practice my web development skills
                    and utilise the techniques I had been learning at the time. You'll be happy to know that
                    I did eventually reach manufacturing proficiency and I used the machine to produce
                    plenty of products!
                </p>
