                    <p>
                        My name is James and I'm a <span id="age-container"></span> year old amateur developer from
                        the UK. Thus-far in my career I have worked as CADCAM Engineer in the furniture industry, but
                        I have been making small programming projects on the side since I was about 14 years
                        old.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm in the process of actively refining my skills and exploring new technologies -
                        one of my ultimate goals is to build my own fully-functional and released application
                        for the web, iOS and Android platforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not working I like to play a bit of golf with my friends (even though I'm dreadful),
                        run recreationally and occasionally do some cycling. I am also a big fan of visiting the many
                        beautiful National Trust properties around the country, as well as planning and undertaking
                        challenging hikes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this page you can get a taste of some of the projects I've developed and I hope that it will
                        serve as a centralised location for all my programming news. Thank you for stopping by!

                <p>
                    As part of my learning experience with HTML and CSS, I produced a small test blog
                    documenting my experiences with a new CNC machine I was learning to use at work. 
                    This was my first ever webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It discusses the early stages and steps I took to try to familiarise 
                    myself with the machine and its associated software, with a view of reaching a working 
                    proficiency. The main motivation for the blog was to practice my web development skills
                    and utilise the techniques I had been learning at the time. You'll be happy to know that
                    I did eventually reach manufacturing proficiency and I used the machine to produce
                    plenty of products!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in viewing the blog, the link can be found

                <p>
                    Moving further into a full-stack dev course I've been following from Codecademy, I 
                    had my first taste of the React.js framework. As part of the learning process, I was
                    tasked with creating a single page application that utilises the Spotify API to allow
                    a user to create and save playlists back to their Spotify account.
                </p>
                <img 
                    src="./resources/images/jammingpp.png" 
                    alt="A picture of a single page React web application"
                />
                <p>
                    A further learning point in the project was to deploy the app to the web and for this 
                    purpose <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" 
                        class="article-link" 
                        target="_blank" 
                        rel="noopener">Netlify</a> was utlisied. It's a very straightforward and useful application for 
                    publishing React apps, and as such the live app can be found
                    <a href="https://cc-jammming-reactpractice.netlify.app/" 
                        class="article-link" 
                        target="_blank" 
                        rel="noopener">at this address</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was quite a challenging task to conquer, being the first React app I had ever developed alone,
                    and there are still a number of bugs present in the app that I would like to fix. Namely:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first attempted search never returns a result</li>
                        <li>A number of users don't seem to be able to authenticate with the app</li>
                        <li>Some users are unable to play previews of the songs</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>       
                    Any ideas on how to fix these issues would be greatly appreciated and you can send me an email 
                    with your thoughts at the address on the contact page!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this was also the first time I had experimented with SVGs and basic aninimations 
                    (which you can see at work as the track preview play button in the app) - another interesting
                    and exciting thing to learn about!
                </p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">React Planner App</button>
            <div class="project content expandable-text">
                <p>
                    In true "Hello, World" fashion, once I had gone a bit further in my study of React, I decided
                    to develop a simple "planner" application... in other words a glorified to-do app! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had covered <a href="https://reactrouter.com/" 
                        class="article-link" 
                        target="_blank" 
                        rel="noopener">ReactRouter</a> at this point and so wanted to practice the principles whilst also
                    making something useful for myself. A simple planning app seemed like a good fit for this set
                    of requirements and provided a good amount of expansion opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point in time, I have made a fully functional but basic implmentation of the to-do list part of
                    the
                    app and I'm working on creating a contact page for storing all my useful connections' details. Since 
                    I have yet to cover any backend content in my learning, I have utilised the 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" 
                        class="article-link" 
                        target="_blank" 
                        rel="noopener"">localStorage</a> property of the browser to store the stateful data I need, but
                        it will be easily possible to implement a backend solution in the future, if I feel so inclined.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-javascript">
// The code in the react component that fetches the "saved" state from localStorage

const [todo, setTodo] = useState(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todo")) || []);
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <img src="./resources/images/JPA-react.png" alt="A picture of a single page React web application">
                <p>
                    I plan to add a third useful page to the application in due course, but the possibility for 
                    expansion is endless and very approachable, due to the modular nature of React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I won't be publishing this app to the web, so I have made it more like a desktop app by creating an
                    executable <code>.bat</code> file that I can run to open it up, which was another short but fun endeavour.
